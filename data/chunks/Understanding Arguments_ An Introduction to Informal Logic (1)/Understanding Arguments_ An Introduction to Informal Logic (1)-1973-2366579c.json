Here it\nis tempting to reason in the following way: There is a 50 percent chance of\ngetting heads on the first toss and a 50 percent chance of getting heads on the\nsecond toss, so after two tosses it is already certain that we will toss heads\nat least once, and thus after eight tosses there should be a 400 percent chance",
