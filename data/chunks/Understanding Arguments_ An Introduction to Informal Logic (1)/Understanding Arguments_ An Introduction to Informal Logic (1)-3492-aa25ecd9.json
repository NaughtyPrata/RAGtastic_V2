In the dome there\nis also a receptor protein which binds to both the clathrin and to the mannose-\n6-phosphate group of the protein which is being transported. The coated\nvesicle then leaves the ER, travels through the cytoplasm, and binds to the\nlysosome through another specific receptor protein. Finally, in a maneuver\ninvolving several more proteins, the vesicle fuses with the lysosome and the\nprotein arrives at its destination.",
