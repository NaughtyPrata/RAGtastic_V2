  "content": "e best way to look at this question is to restate it so that the first two rules\ncan be used. Instead of asking what the probability is that heads will come up\nat least once, we can ask what the probability is that heads will notcome up at\nleast once. To say that heads will not come up even once is equivalent to say-\ning that tails will come up eight times in a row. By Rule 2 we know how to\ncompute that probability: It is 1/2 multiplied by itself eight times, and that, as\nwe saw, is 1/256. Final",
