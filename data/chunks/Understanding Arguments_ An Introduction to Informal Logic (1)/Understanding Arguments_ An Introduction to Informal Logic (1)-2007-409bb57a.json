  "content": " that Wendy prob-\nably has colon cancer.4\nWhat is the correct answer? To calculate the probability that a person\nwho tests positive actually has colon cancer, we need to divide the number\nof favorable outcomes by the number of total outcomes. The favorable out-\ncomes  include  everyone  who  tests  positive  and  really  has  colon  cancer.\nThis outcome is not “favorable” to Wendy, so we will describe this group as\ntrue  positives.  The  total  outcomes  include  everyone  who  tests  positive.\n",
