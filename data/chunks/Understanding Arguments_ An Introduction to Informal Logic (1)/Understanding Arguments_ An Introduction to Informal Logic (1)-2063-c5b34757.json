Does  having  one  child  die  a  cot  death  increase  the\nchances that you will have another do so?\nRay Hill . . . estimates that siblings of children who die of cot death are be-\ntween 10 and 22 times more likely than average to die the same way. Using the\nfigure of 1 in 1,303 for the chance of a first cot death, we see that the chances of\na second cot death in the same family are somewhere between 1 in 60 and 1 in\n130. There isn’t enough data",
