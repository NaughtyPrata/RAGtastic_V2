  "content": "ve said I think those Christians who adopt a\nfreer  attitude  toward  scripture  and  do  not  feel  that  their  acceptance  of\nChristianity commits them to predestination, or Hell, or original sin, or jus-\ntification by faith, or exclusivism—those Christians have their hearts in the\nright place. But I also think their feet may be planted on the slippery slope\nto heresy, and that more conservative Christians, who would accord greater\nauthority to scripture, have a clearer right to consider them",
