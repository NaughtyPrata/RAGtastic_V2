Listing the\nsame  premise  twice  will  not  make  the  argument  any  better  from  a  logical\npoint of view.\nSometimes guardingterms can also be dropped. If I say, “I think Miranda\nis at home, so we can probably meet her there,” this argument might be rep-\nresented in standard form thus:\n(1) I think Miranda is at home.\n(2) We can probably meet her there. (from 1)\nThis is misleading. ",
