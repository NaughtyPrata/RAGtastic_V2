  "content": " rape ought to allow the un-\nborn person to use her body for the hour he needs, we should not conclude\nthat he has a right to do so; we should conclude that she is self-centered,\ncallous, indecent, but not unjust, if she refuses. The complaints are no less\ngrave; they are just different. However, there is no need to insist on this\npoint. If anyone does wish to deduce “he has a right” from “you ought,”\nthen all the same he must surely grant that there are cases in which it is not\nmorally required",
