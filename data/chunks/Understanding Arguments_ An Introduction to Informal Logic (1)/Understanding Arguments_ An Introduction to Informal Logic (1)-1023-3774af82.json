  "content": "ase\nletters “x,” “y,” and “z” can be replaced by any numbers in mathematics, so\nwe can use the lowercase letters “p,” “q,” “r,” “s,” and so on as variables that\ncan be replaced by any propositions in logic. We will also use the symbol\n“&” (called an ampersand) for “and.”\nConsider the expression “p& q.” Is it true or false? There is obviously no\nanswer to this question. This is not because we do not know what “p” and\n“q” stand for, for in fact “p” and “q” do not stand for any proposition at all.\n",
