(In this case, there is only one such row—\nrow 6.) If the conclusion on this line is also true, it is marked “OK.” If every\nline  in  which  the  premises  are  all  true  is  OK,  then  the  argument  form\nis valid. Marking all this may seem rather childish, but it is worth doing.\nFirst,  it  helps  guard  against  mistakes.",
