It might be\na normal deck or it might contain only diamonds or only aces of spades or\nany other combination of cards. It costs nothing to play. If you bet that the\ncard you draw will be a spade, and it is a spade, then you win $100. If you\nbet that the card you draw will not be a spade, and it is not a spade, then\nyou win $90. ",
