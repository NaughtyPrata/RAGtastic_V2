  "content": "e total number of\npeople without colon cancer into those who test positive and those who do\nnot test positive. Here we use the conditional probability of a positive test,\ngiven that a person does not have colon cancer [Pr(e|~h)]. This probability\nwas given as 0.03, and 0.03 ×99,700 = 2,991. This number means that, out of\na normal population of 99,700 without colon cancer, 2,991 will test positive.\nSince the figures in this column must add up to a total of 99,700, the remain-\ning figure is 99,700",
