  "content": "d  discover  that  an  ace  tends  to  come  up\nroughly one-thirteenth of the time. From this we could draw the conclusion\nthat the chance of drawing an ace is one in thirteen.\nBut we do not have to go to all this trouble. We can assume that each of the\nfifty-two cards has an equal chance of being selected. Given this assumption,\nan obvious line of reasoning runs as follows: There are four aces in a standard\nfifty-two-card deck, so the probability of selecting one randomly is four in\nfifty-two. ",
