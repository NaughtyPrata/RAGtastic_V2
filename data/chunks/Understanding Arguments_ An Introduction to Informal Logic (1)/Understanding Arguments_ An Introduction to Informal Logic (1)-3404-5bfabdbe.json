Suppose\nwe have confirmed and explained the principle that a sphere floats in water\nif and only if it is less dense than water. Suppose also that another principle\nis  well  confirmed:  A substance  gets  smaller  and  denser  as  it  gets  colder.\nTaken together, these principles predict that a sphere of ice should sink in\nwater.  Ice  is  colder  than  water, ",
