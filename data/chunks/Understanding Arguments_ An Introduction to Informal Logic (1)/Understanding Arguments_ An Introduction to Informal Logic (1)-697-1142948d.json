  "content": " like Thomas Eakins, who was born in 1844, died in\n1916,  and  is  the  subject  of  a  great  exhibition  that  has  just  opened  in  the\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art. It is not simply that in his hands painting be-\ncame an exact science, so that if he paints two men rowing on a river, we can\ntell the month, day, and the hour that they passed under a certain bridge. We\nadmire Eakins for that, but we prize him above all for the new dimension of\nmoral awareness that he brought to American painting",
