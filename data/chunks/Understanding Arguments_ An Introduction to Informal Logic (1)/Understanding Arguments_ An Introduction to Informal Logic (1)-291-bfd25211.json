Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.\nIn a cooperative activity, you are not supposed to tell lies. Beyond this, you\nare expected not to talk off the top of your head either. When we make a\nstatement, we can be challenged by someone asking, “Do you really believe\nthat?” or “Why do you believe that?” That a person has the right to ask such\nquestions shows that statement making is governed by the rule of Quality.",
