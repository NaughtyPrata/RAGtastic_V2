You are certain to\nget either heads or tails on the first flip, so this probability is 1. Then, regard-\nless of what happens on the first flip, the probability of getting the opposite\non the second flip is 1/2. These results are independent, so the probability\nof their conjunction by Rule 2 is the product 1 ×1/2 = ",
