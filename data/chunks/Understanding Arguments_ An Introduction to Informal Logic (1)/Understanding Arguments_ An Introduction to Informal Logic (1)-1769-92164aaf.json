  "content": "related to simplicity.One kind of simplicity is captured by the\ncelebrated principle known as Occam’s razor, which tells us not to multiply\nentities beyond necessity. Physicists, for example, should not postulate new\nkinds of subatomic particles or forces unless there is no other way to explain\ntheir  experimental  results.  Similar  standards  apply  in  everyday  life.  We\nshould not believe in ghosts unless they really are necessary to explain the\nnoises in our attic or some other phenomenon.",
