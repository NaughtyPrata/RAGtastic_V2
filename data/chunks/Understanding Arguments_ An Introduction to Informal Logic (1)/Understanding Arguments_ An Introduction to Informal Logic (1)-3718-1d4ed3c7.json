  "content": "e essential problem here is\nthat to make the doctrine of the universality of sin plausible we must define sin in a way which\nmakes sinners even of those whose offenses, though serious, are comparatively minor, whereas\nthe seriousness of the punishment they are to receive seems appropriate (if it is ever appro-\npriate) only for those who are extremely wicked. I say more about the doctrine that sin is uni-\nversal below.\n**See, for example, Matthew 5:22, 29–30, 8:11–12, 13:36–50, 18:8–9, 23:29–33, ",
