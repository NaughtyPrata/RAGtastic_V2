It will not save\nhim from perishing. It will not make those who care for him feel better.\nThe  upshot  of  this  simple  example  is  that  the  truthof  what  we  say  is\nrarely just a matter of definition. Whether what we have said is true or not\nwill depend, for the most part, on how things stand in the world. Abraham\nL",
