  "content": "re that you have a complete record when you inevitably have to revisit your prompting work-either to pick it up in the future (you'd be surprised how much you can forget after just a short break), to test prompt performance on different versions of a model, and to help debug future errors. beyond the fields in this table, it's also helpful to track the version of the prompt (iteration), a field to capture if the result was ok/not ok/sometimes ok, and a field to capture feedback. if you're lucky enough to be using vertex ai studio, save your prompts (using the same name and version as listed in your documentation) and track the hyperlink to the saved prompt in the table. this way, you're always one click away from re-running your prompts. when working on a retrieval augmented generation system, you should also capture the specific aspects of the rag system that impact what content was inserted into the prompt, including the query, chunk settings, chunk output, and other information. onc",
