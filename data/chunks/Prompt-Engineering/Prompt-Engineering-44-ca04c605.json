  "content": " reasoning steps will improve the output. promptwhen i was 3 years old, my partner was 3 times my age. now, i am 20 years old. how old is my partner? let's think step by step. output1. let's assume my current age is \"x\" years. 2. when i was 3 years old, my age was 3 years. 3. my partner's age at that time was 3 times my age, which means my partner's age was 3 * 3 = 9 years. 4. now, i am 20 years old, which means my age has increased by 20 - 3 = 17 years since i was 3 years old. 5. since my partner's age was 9 years when i was 3 years old, and my age has increased by 17 years, my partner's age must have also increased by 17 years. 6. therefore, my partner's current age is 9 + 17 = 26 years. so, my partner is 26 years old. table 12. an example of chain of thought prompting alright, now the final answer is correct. that's because we clearly instructed the llm to explain each step instead of just returning an answer. it's interesting to see that the model adds up the 17 increased years. in",
