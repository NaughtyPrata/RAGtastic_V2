  "content": "ocument the various prompt attempts the last tip was mentioned before in this chapter, but we can't stress enough how important it is: document your prompt attempts in full detail so you can learn over time what went well and what did not. prompt outputs can differ across models, across sampling settings, and even across different versions of the same model. moreover, even across identical prompts to the same model, small differences in output sentence formatting and word choice can occur. (for example, as mentioned previously, if two tokens have the same predicted probability, ties may be broken randomly. this can then impact subsequent predicted tokens.). prompt engineering february 202565 we recommend creating a google sheet with table 21 as a template. the advantages of this approach are that you have a complete record when you inevitably have to revisit your prompting work-either to pick it up in the future (you'd be surprised how much you can forget after just a short break), to ",
