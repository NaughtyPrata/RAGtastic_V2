# sRAG Development Log

## 2025-04-27 - RAG System Implementation

### Completed
- Set up basic project structure
- Implemented document preprocessing functionality with improved chunking
- Created PDF processor for document parsing
- Implemented document chunking with hybrid strategies
- Created Express API endpoints for document operations
- Designed and implemented Vault-Tec themed UI
- Connected UI to backend API
- Integrated Groq API for LLM responses
- Implemented specialized metadata extraction
- Added more aggressive document chunking with better retrieval
- Enhanced context assembly for better results

### Test Results
- Successfully processed Prompt-Engineering.pdf into 667 chunks
- Verified chunk storage in data/chunks directory
- Document retrieval correctly finds relevant chunks for queries
- System successfully identifies Lee Boonstra as author of the book
- System can identify 5 prompt engineering techniques from the book
- Groq LLM integration works correctly with llama3-8b-8192 model

### Key Improvements
- Reduced chunk size to 300 chars (from 500) for more granular retrieval
- Increased chunk overlap to 150 chars (from 100) to maintain context
- Added specialized metadata extraction for author, title, and date
- Implemented special handling for author-related queries
- Prioritized first pages for general book questions
- Added document metadata as additional context

### Next Steps
- Implement proper vector embeddings for semantic search
- Add support for more document types (TXT, DOCX, etc.)
- Enhance UI with more Vault-Tec themed elements
- Implement the full agentic flow as per design

## Implementation Details

- Used simple server.js with Express API to handle requests
- Created document preprocessing pipeline with hybrid chunking
- Implemented basic context retrieval using simple keyword matching
- Integrated Groq API for LLM responses using llama3-8b-8192 model
- Connected UI to backend API for data display and interaction

## Access

The system is now accessible at:
- UI: http://localhost:3002
- API: http://localhost:3002/api
- Documents are stored in /documents directory
- Processed chunks are stored in /data/chunks
