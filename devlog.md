# Development Log

## 2025-04-27: CriticAgent Implementation

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Implemented CriticAgent flow in the UI
- [x] Added visualization of refinement loop in agent network modal
- [x] Created special styling for refinement paths with animation
- [x] Added iteration counter badge for CriticAgent
- [x] Updated API.js to default to the complete RAG flow with CriticAgent
- [x] Enhanced response display to show query refinement history
- [x] Added quality score based on CriticAgent evaluation

### Changes Made

1. Updated `agent-modal.js` to visualize the RetrieverAgent → SynthesizerAgent → CriticAgent flow
2. Added special refinement loop animation for when CriticAgent sends queries back to RetrieverAgent
3. Created notification badge to display iteration count for refinement loops
4. Updated app.js to display detailed information about query refinements to users
5. Configured the API to use the complete RAG flow endpoint by default
6. Added quality score calculation based on CriticAgent evaluation

### Next Steps

- Implement the PresentationAgent component
- Create more detailed visualizations for the complete flow
- Add more detailed statistics about each agent's performance
- Create a dedicated panel for CriticAgent evaluation details
# sRAG Development Log

## 2025-04-27 - RAG System Implementation

### Completed
- Set up basic project structure
- Implemented document preprocessing functionality with improved chunking
- Created PDF processor for document parsing
- Implemented document chunking with hybrid strategies
- Created Express API endpoints for document operations
- Designed and implemented Vault-Tec themed UI
- Connected UI to backend API
- Integrated Groq API for LLM responses
- Implemented specialized metadata extraction
- Added more aggressive document chunking with better retrieval
- Enhanced context assembly for better results

### Test Results
- Successfully processed Prompt-Engineering.pdf into 667 chunks
- Verified chunk storage in data/chunks directory
- Document retrieval correctly finds relevant chunks for queries
- System successfully identifies Lee Boonstra as author of the book
- System can identify 5 prompt engineering techniques from the book
- Groq LLM integration works correctly with llama3-8b-8192 model

### Key Improvements
- Reduced chunk size to 300 chars (from 500) for more granular retrieval
- Increased chunk overlap to 150 chars (from 100) to maintain context
- Added specialized metadata extraction for author, title, and date
- Implemented special handling for author-related queries
- Prioritized first pages for general book questions
- Added document metadata as additional context

### 2025-04-27 - Fixed Preprocessing Error

### Completed
- Fixed "Preprocessing error: Load failed" issue in the UI connection
- Added enhanced error handling in API client
- Modified backend to support both `documents` and `documentIds` parameters for backwards compatibility
- Added detailed error logging throughout the preprocessing flow
- Successfully tested document preprocessing

### Key Improvements
- Fixed mismatch between frontend API calls and backend expectations
- Enhanced error reporting for better debugging
- Improved error handling in API client

## 2025-04-27 - Eliminated Roleplay Elements and Enhanced SynthesizerAgent

### Completed
- Fixed roleplay elements in both RetrieverAgent and SynthesizerAgent
- Enhanced filtering to remove themed content
- Improved SynthesizerAgent prompt to generate professional, academic responses with:
  - Direct answers to user queries
  - Contextual explanations of concepts
  - Related follow-up questions section
  - Related resource recommendations
- Implemented comprehensive regex filtering to ensure clean responses
- Enhanced agent flow from RetrieverAgent to SynthesizerAgent

### Key Improvements
- Created a more robust `removeRoleplayElements` function with multi-pass filtering
- Updated system prompts to emphasize academic, professional tone
- Added structural requirements to agent responses
- Enhanced filtering for both text patterns and paragraph-level content
- Eliminated roleplay references in error messages

## Next Steps
- Implement proper vector embeddings for semantic search
- Add support for more document types (TXT, DOCX, etc.)
- Implement the CriticAgent component shown in the agentic flow
- Add improved presentation formatting
- Continue implementing the full agentic flow as per design

## Implementation Details

- Used simple server.js with Express API to handle requests
- Created document preprocessing pipeline with hybrid chunking
- Implemented basic context retrieval using simple keyword matching
- Integrated Groq API for LLM responses using llama3-8b-8192 model
- Connected UI to backend API for data display and interaction

## Access

The system is now accessible at:
- UI: http://localhost:3002
- API: http://localhost:3002/api
- Documents are stored in /documents directory
- Processed chunks are stored in /data/chunks
