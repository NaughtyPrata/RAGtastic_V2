## 2025-04-26: UI Enhancements - CRT Effects (Update 13)

### Work Completed:
- [x] Increased animated scanline opacity from 0.05 back to 0.1
- [x] Kept the smooth gradient transition for seamless animation
- [x] Maintained the slower 15s animation cycle for subtle movement

### Current Settings:
- Moving Scanline: opacity 0.1, 300px height, 15s animation cycle, gradient edges
- Horizontal Scanlines: opacity 0.05, 4px spacing, static effect
- Vignette: dark corners at 0.4 opacity with inset shadow
- Grid Lines: disabled/commented out

### Technical Solutions:
- Created both effects directly in HTML to bypass JavaScript issues
- Used CSS background image gradient technique to create grid lines
- Maintained the Fallout Vault-Tec green color scheme (rgba(53, 126, 60, 0.8))
- Ensured all effects are non-interactive (pointer-events: none)

- [x] Further decreased static grid lines opacity from 0.15 to 0.1 for very subtle background grid
- [x] Adjusted TV effect vignette:
  - Maintained center transparency at 40%
  - Lightened the dark corners to 0.4 opacity (from 0.7)

### Previous Changes:
- [x] Reduced scanlines opacity from 0.8 to 0.4
- [x] Lessened static grid lines opacity from 0.25 to 0.15
- [x] Enhanced TV effect vignette with stronger gradient and box-shadow

### Technical Details:
- Modified `/simple_ui/css/components/terminal.css` for scanlines and vignette changes
- Modified `/simple_ui/css/grid-overlay.css` for grid opacity adjustment

### Next Steps:
- Consider adding more CRT effects like bloom/glow
- Optimize performance for lower-end devices
- Add toggle options for users to adjust effect intensity
