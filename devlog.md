# sRAG Development Log

## 2025-04-27 - RAG System Implementation

### Completed
- Set up basic project structure
- Implemented document preprocessing functionality
- Created PDF processor for document parsing
- Implemented document chunking with hybrid strategies
- Created Express API endpoints for document operations
- Designed and implemented Vault-Tec themed UI
- Connected UI to backend API
- Updated UI to make API calls to the server
- Implemented simple RAG retrieval mechanism
- Added Groq integration for LLM component

### Test Results
- Successfully processed Prompt-Engineering.pdf into 263 chunks
- Verified chunk storage in data/chunks directory
- Simple keyword-based retrieval finding relevant chunks
- UI correctly displaying processed documents

### Next Steps
- Add proper Groq API key for LLM component
- Implement embedding generation for semantic search
- Add support for more document types (TXT, DOCX, etc.)
- Enhance UI with more Vault-Tec themed elements
- Implement the full agentic flow as per design

### Known Issues
- RAG API requires valid Groq API key
- Simple retrieval uses keyword matching instead of semantic search
- No proper error handling for invalid documents
- UI needs more Fallout theming

## Next Phase Planning
- Implement proper vector embedding for chunks
- Add FAISS for vector search
- Implement embedding cache for faster retrieval
- Add proper agent conversation flow
- Enhance UI with more Vault-Tec terminal elements
